# the-fifteen-puzzle-ai
This is an implementation of an AI capable of solving the fifteen game (actually, the eight game) using Breadth-First-Search and Depth-First-Search.

In taquin2.py file you can change the initialBoard variable to adjust the starting position, and run either BFS(initialBoard) or DFS(initialBoard, []) (or both if you'd like to compare).
